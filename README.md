This repository provides the instructions for requesting access to the code associated with our paper "**A Wolf in Sheepâ€™s Clothing: Practical Black-box Adversarial Attacks for Evading Learning-basedWindows Malware Detection in the Wild**", USENIX Security 2024.

# 1. Introduction

MalGuise is a practical black-box adversarial attack framework that generates adversarial malware files, to understand and assess the security risks of learning-based Windows malware detection.
In particular, MalGuise applies a more fine-grained transformation to the control flow graph (CFG) of Windows malware, which not only manipulates its nodes but also its edges

You can find more detailed information in our published paper [[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02886)].
